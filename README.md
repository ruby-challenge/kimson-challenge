here is the challenge.

complete the mergeStrings function in your editor. It has 2 parameters. 1. A string, 'a' 2. A string, 'b' Your function must merge strings 'a' and 'b', and then return a single merged string. A merge operation on two strings is described as follows: Append alternating characters from 'a' and 'b' to some new string 'mergedString'. Once all of the characters in one of the strings have been merged, append the remaining characters in the other string. Your function must return the merged string. Example: 'a' = abc 'b' = def the function should return adbecf. A second example: 'a' = ab, 'b' = zsd the function should return azbsd. Constraints: length of 'a' and 'b' should each be greater than or equal to 1 but less than or equal to 10. Please solve this using Ruby.
